# Hi-Hi
Write a function that allows case-insensitive comparison (a.k.a. ordering) of two strings. The return value should be analogous to that from strcmp:

Code will run and allow the user to input two strings

The results will be dependent on how the strings compare;
	-1: If the strings don't match, and the first string put in has an earlier character (ie. A<B)
	0: If the strings match
	1: If the strings don't match, and the second string put in has an earlier character (ie. A<B)
